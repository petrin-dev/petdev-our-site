Here at Petrin Development Services, it’s a poorly-guarded secret that we embrace the Jamstack. This website is built on Hugo, and perhaps someday something else newer in the stack. Without question, the performance benefits, ease of use, and portability make it the perfect solution for us. For other clients, when there isn’t a lot of complex application logic — Hugo is a no-brainer. Hugo *can* definitely handle complex application logic, but some clients are far more comfortable remaining in the WordPress ecosystem.

The [literally thousands of plugins](https://kinsta.com/blog/wordpress-statistics/#featuredSnippet) make future extension of a website very straightforward and not overly costly. The broader WordPress community is fantastic, and there’s no shortage of “how-to” guides for just about every use-case or extension of functionality. The primary supporting organization, [Automattic](https://automattic.com/), makes fantastic software and [iterates without pause](https://automattic.com/how-we-work/#our-development-process-data-informed-user-driven). There’s a lot to like, and WP is a reliably safe choice.

Specifically, [WordPress 5.9 was released at the end of January](https://www.notion.so/f9c4497b7b05436e9876883a02ac4f10). With it comes a number of quality-of-life upgrades for Gutenberg. Most prominently, [full-site editing support](https://thewhitelabelagency.com/wordpress-5-9-release-with-full-site-editing-is-coming/) — Gutenberg for Globals, the zenith of [Phase 2](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/12/08/gutenberg-phase-2/) of the project. We are one step closer to Gutenberg’s inevitable checkmate against upstart site builders for small businesses — namely Squarespace and Wix. They’ve already dealt a resounding blow to WP page-builders in Phase 1 — Elementor, WPBakery, etc.

As of this writing, full-site editing needs to be supported in a theme to be leveraged by its admins. [Twenty Twenty-Two](https://wordpress.org/themes/twentytwentytwo/) includes it — while [Underscores](https://underscores.me/) does not. Both themes are authored by Automattic, so this is telling. In a way, it makes sense — Twenty Twenty-Two comes pre-installed on vanilla WordPress installations. Underscores, conversely, is aimed at developers wanting a best practices-laden boilerplate to build from. Automattic is known for their copious documentation, and there’s plenty of first- and second-party guides on how to get started adding full-site editing to your theme. So it’s only a matter of time before it becomes ubiquitous — [similar to WordPress itself in market share](https://kinsta.com/wordpress-market-share/). 

I didn't even get to theme.json, where [version 2 has been released](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/01/08/updates-for-settings-styles-and-theme-json/). The subtext will likely only thrill developers such as ourselves. Needless to say, it makes a number of under-the-hood improvements to unlock optional Gutenberg settings to provide even more granular control of the editing experience. We're big fans, but the benefits of theme.json don't always resonate with our clients. It's still the unsung hero of Phase 2.

For the average marketing manager, WordPress remains the blue ribbon choice. The trendiness of the Jamstack is mostly bandied about by more tech savvy teams — this intro to this article being a(nother) case in point. The benefits, albeit completely legitimate, are offset by the penchant for teams to want to avoid the abstraction and development overhead if they don't have development resources at their disposal. WordPress is that choice, and it’s only continuing to get better. WordPress 5.9 is a work of art, and [6.0 is right around the corner](https://wptavern.com/looking-ahead-to-wordpress-6-0-the-early-roadmap). Exciting times for nerds like us.
