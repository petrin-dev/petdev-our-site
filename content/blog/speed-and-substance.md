If you work anywhere near the web publishing space, it comes as no surprise that Google is the tastemaker when it comes to content marketing. First of all, it's now been [over twenty years](http://googlepress.blogspot.com/2000/06/google-launches-worlds-largest-search.html) since they become number one in search. More recently, the advent of [Core Web Vitals](https://web.dev/vitals/ "Core Web Vitals") flipped web development on its ear, rewarding teams focused on positive mobile experiences.

At PDS, we've given the nod for years to static site generators -- such as Hugo, which this very site is built upon -- so this change came with little heavy-lifting on our site. For some of our clients, however, this became an urgent re-awakening to long-neglected maintenance. Many WordPress instances out-of-date and behind-the-times were suddenly in a mad dash to follow best practices.

In some cases, these updates were low-hanging fruit. Clients who long neglected WordPress Core, PHP, and Linux upgrades suddenly became all for them. Turning to medium-hanging fruit, everyone suddenly became an advocate for proper image sizing and optimization and proper asset preloading. Finally, the highest-hanging fruit -- legacy themes, and all of the baggage that comes with trying to lean them out after years of code shortcuts.

To quickly summarize, there are three primary Core Web Vitals -- at least until [Google adds their fourth](https://www.searchenginejournal.com/google-responsiveness-metric/429466/). They are --
* **Largest Contentful Paint** -- what is the largest element (in height), and how long does it take to load?;
* **First Input Delay** -- at which point does the page become interactive?;
* **Cumulative Layout Shift** -- how much does the page grow (again, in height) as the user navigates?

The best practice, as you might've guessed, is to keep all of those metrics as low as possible. To do so, themes must be as lean as possible. For some teams, this push necessitated an embrace of static site generators, [in some cases without ditching WordPress](https://wp2static.com/ "in some cases without ditching WordPress"). For others, getting their WordPress house in order was the top priority. In all cases, the main beneficiary was the end user -- as it always should be.

On the content side, not much has changed. If you write good content, and your vitals aren't too atrocious, you can expect your rank to not change too much. Above all else, if your site is accessible, accessible in a timely manner, and your content meets best practices and contains substance, people will find it. Don't expect that last bit to change, even as other web conventions do.

As always, Petrin Development Services is ahead of the game. We've embraced static site generators for years because of how much optimization you get out-of-the-box, and recommend it as the appropriate solution for a select number of our clients. On the WordPress side, Gutenberg is continuing to provide a leaner blueprint for site-building [when compared to other page composition tools](https://wpastra.com/gutenberg-vs-elementor/ "Gutenberg vs. Elementor") -- and we conversely recommend it as the appropriate solution for another subset of our clients. Whichever the tool in use, speedy sites are the new expectation rather than the ideal.
