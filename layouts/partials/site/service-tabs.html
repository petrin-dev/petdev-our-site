                <h2>Digital & Brand Design</h2>
                <p>We provide conventional and custom designs to fit any web project, and specialize in providing complete brand servicing to new and existing businesses.</p>
                <h3>Brand Palette</h3>
                <p>Whether you're refreshing an existing brand or starting anew, we provide the full suite of brand development services. We'll work within your brand constraints to develop a dynamic design system to drive all of your initiatives.</p>
                <h3>Digital Web Designs</h3>
                <p>We can design new landing pages for your existing site, refresh elements of your current theme, or start fresh to give your website a new look. This can be paired with our branding service outlined above, or as an independent service.</p>
                <h3>Print and Beyond</h3>
                <p>In addition to brand and website, our team can also provide marketing assets to aid your sales team. Our most common service is whitepaper design, but we also offer platform and application skinning.</p>

                <h2>Full-Stack Web Development</h2>
                <p>We provide both front-end and back-end development, ensuring your design is both pixel-perfect and completely editable. We offer development on trusted platforms, as well as modern and specialty projects.</p>
                <h3>Traditional Platforms</h3>
                <p>WordPress is the top name in web publishing and content management. It's no surprise, as approximately 40% of websites run it. We pair our performance-first development service with WordPress's robust plugin ecosystem to provide fully-featured websites for all business use-cases.</p>
                <h3>Modern Platforms</h3>
                <p>Most marketing sites don't need to leverage the full power of WordPress. In those instances, we opt for lean development in the name of speed, and Hugo is our top choice of platform. We also provide specialty JAMstack options for projects where speed is the top priority.</p>
                <h3>Specialty Projects</h3>
                <p>Our most common requests are for marketing sites, but we also offer specialty site packages. We have the expertise to handle the needs of your store, interactive infographic, event, application, game, platform, product launch, or new service.</p>

                <h2>Web Hosting</h2>
                <p>Our managed hosting service is fairly priced, as you only pay for maintenance. We'll configure and launch your app on trusted services we use ourselves, and you only pay for what you use. </p>
                <h3>Pay-as-you-Scale</h3>
                <p>Our hosting service is provided at-cost, and separately managed by trusted providers. For WordPress sites, our recommendation is WPEngine. For modern and specialty sites, our recommendation is Netlify. Pricing is based on usage, so an increase in hosting costs will only occur as your business scales.</p>
                <h3>Managed Hosting</h3>
                <p>Our basic managed hosting package includes setup and monitoring of your site instance, with maintenance priced at a discount from our normal hourly support rate. We offer multiple managed options, with one sure to fit the amount of monthly maintenance your site requires.</p>
                <h3>Unmanaged Hosting</h3>
                <p>For some of our clients, site updates are infrequent enough to not warrant maintenance. For just the cost of hosting (paid to the provider, not us), we'll monitor your site for uptime. Should there be a need to intervene, it is priced at the normal hourly support rate.</p>

                <h3>Analytical Insights</h3>
